      <h1>Generalist’s Mentality</h1>
      <p>
        In a world that celebrates specialization and expertise, it can be easy to fall into the trap of believing that success
        and fulfillment can only be found by mastering a particular field or skill. Recently, I have been reading Morgan
        Snyder’s book titled “Becoming a King.” A chapter of this book that stood out to me and inspired me inspired me to seek
        opportunities to learn how to do more things on my own and be more self-reliant. Of course, there will be things I
        can’t do on my own, but there is plenty I can learn and do on my own outside of what a professional is needed for.

          "In the chapter on Becoming a Generalist in Morgan Snyder’s book Becoming a King, the author emphasizes the importance
          of developing a broad range of skills and interests rather than specializing in one area. He argues that being a
          generalist allows a person to adapt to different situations, think creatively, and lead with flexibility. The author
          also discusses the need for men to pursue meaningful relationships and engage in acts of service to develop their
          character and leadership skills. He encourages readers to embrace a growth mindset and to view challenges and failures
          as opportunities for learning and growth. Overall, the chapter promotes a holistic approach to personal development
          and leadership."

      <h2>What It Means to Be a Generalist</h2>
      <p>
        There are a few things I consider myself good at, including learning musical instruments, cooking chicken, making coffee,
        basic carpentry work, and the list goes on. But there are also a few things I am learning that I may not be as good at,
        including dog training, basic carpentry work, programming, balancing and maintaining a budget, fixing a car, and plumbing.
      </p>

      <p>
        But what does it mean to be a generalist, and how can this approach benefit us? At its core, being a generalist means
        embracing a lifelong process of learning and growth. It means being open to new experiences, ideas, and perspectives,
        and being willing to step outside our comfort zones to explore new areas of interest.
      </p>

      <h2>Benefits of Being a Generalist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Generalists are more adaptable and flexible: In today’s rapidly changing world, the ability to adapt and pivot quickly
          is essential. By developing a broad range of skills and interests, generalists are better equipped to navigate change
          and uncertainty.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generalists are more creative: When we become too narrowly focused on one area, our thinking can become stagnant.
          Generalists, on the other hand, are constantly exposed to new ideas and perspectives, which can help them to think
          more creatively and innovatively.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generalists are better able to connect with others: By engaging in a wide range of activities and pursuits, generalists
          are more likely to meet and connect with people from diverse backgrounds and walks of life. This can help them to
          build more meaningful relationships and foster greater empathy and understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generalists are more fulfilled: While specializing in one area may lead to short-term success, it can also lead to
          burnout and a lack of fulfillment in the long run. Generalists, on the other hand, are constantly learning and growing,
          which can lead to greater satisfaction and a deeper sense of purpose.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practical Steps to Become a Generalist</h2>
      <div className="steps">
        <ol>
          <li>Embrace a growth mindset: Believe that you can learn and grow in new areas, even if you’re starting from scratch or seemingly failing.</li>
          <li>Pursue diverse interests: Take up a new hobby or pursue an interest outside of your area of expertise.</li>
          <li>Seek out new experiences: Travel to a new place, try a new cuisine, or attend a cultural event.</li>
          <li>Connect with others: Seek out relationships with people who have different backgrounds and perspectives than your own.</li>
          <li>Engage in acts of service: Volunteer your time and talents to a cause you care about, and use this as an opportunity to learn and grow.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Dealing with Failure</h2>
        <p>
          A challenge with this process is pushing through failure. I have been dealing with this recently with some plumbing
          issues in my shared house. We have tried a few different things, and even had a plumber come out to the house to fix
          the issue with only temporary success. With consistent failures and a month remaining on our lease, I have been very
          tempted to give in and get frustrated. Another way to channel your inner generalists is to keep learning from your
          failures. By aiming to learn more about the issue you are facing, you may gain the insight you need to fix the overall
          problem. And the worst-case scenario to this approach is that you learn you need to hire a professional to fix the
          issue. The worst-case scenario to brute force “finesse” is usually spending more money on a professional to fix what
          you broke when you “fixed” the problem.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          As I am also going through this process, I plan to write more and more about my experience in learning more. Every
          day there is a chance to learn something new or practice something you should already know, and it just takes being
          willing to grow and learn from failure to not miss it.
