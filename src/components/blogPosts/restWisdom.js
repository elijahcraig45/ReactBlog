        <h1>The Wisdom of Rest: Conquering Hurry Sickness and Finding Renewal</h1>
      <p className="">
        Over the past few years, I have been living life from school semester to semester. Usually there are short breaks
        in between, but for most of the year I have been taking classes or working some sort of job, with little break
        from the hurry of life. It wasn't until this past January that I began to notice and pay attention to my growth
        and my time. It started with my mornings: I wake up, start my bathroom routine, walk and feed the dog, and make
        coffee and breakfast. Once I have my coffee, I grab my iPad and my Bible and do some reading and planning for the
        day. Every part of my morning routine is intentional and thoughtful once I start making my coffee. This time in
        reflection and planning has started a chain reaction of realization and work on one thing I thought I was really
        good at: rest.
      </p>

      <p className="">
        For me, rest used to be all about physical rest. Sleep has always been super important for me and something I
        prioritized, especially in early college. But lately, I have realized that rest is meant to be more; rest is about
        physical, mental, and spiritual restoration. Rest is a time for restoration and recovery. It is a time to slow
        down, reflect, and reconnect with oneself, one's purpose, and one's relationships. It is a time to be still,
        listen, and gain clarity and perspective.
      </p>

      <p className="">
        Rest is not just a luxury, but a necessity. Without rest, we become depleted, stressed, and burnt out. We lose
        our creativity, productivity, and effectiveness. We become disconnected from ourselves and others, and we lose
        touch with what really matters.
      </p>

      <p className="">
        Rest can take many forms, and it may be different for everyone. Rest can be taking a nap or going to be early,
        taking a walk or a hike, reading a book, cooking, catching up on a TV show, or any number of other things.
        Deciding what to do with your rest time can seem daunting, but there are a few things we can consider when we do
        take time to rest:
      </p>

      <ol className="">
        <li>
          Consider your energy levels: Rest doesn't always mean doing nothing, but in some cases that may be exactly what
          we need. If you are feeling physically tired, you may want to consider some physically restful activities like
          taking a nap or some light yoga. For mental exhaustion, reading a book, meditation, or yoga may be good.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prioritize things you enjoy: Rest should be something we enjoy, and it can be a time to finally do the things
          we always say we don't have time for. If you like gardening, but never have time, your rest could be planting a
          new garden. Again, rest doesn't have to involve doing nothing - rest is a time to recharge and restore some of
          who you are.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid hurry sickness: Hurry sickness, or a constant sense of time based urgency, can kill your rest. Rest time
          is not the time to finish all the work you need to get done or stress about deadlines and unpleasant things.
          There is a time to worry about all of those things, but it is also important to recharge and do the things we
          enjoy. Life is so much more than just work and deadlines and things to do: we were made to enjoy life.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider spiritual rest: time in scripture can often be stressful if we aren't used to it, but if we let go of
          the idea that we are reading because we "should" be, it can make it more restful and inviting. The Bible tells
          us a lot about rest, and it has been my inspiration for some of the rest practices in my own life. The Bible
          teaches us the importance of rest and provides many scriptures that speak to its benefits. For instance, in
          Exodus 20:8-10, God commands us to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. In Matthew 11:28-30, Jesus
          invites us to come to Him and find rest for our souls. And in Psalm 127:2, we are reminded that God gives to
          His beloved even in their sleep. Whether or not you believe in the Bible, I am sure you can agree that taking a
          day off to rest and enjoy life is not a bad thing.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p className="">
        Rest can be a cure for hurry sickness. Hurry sickness is a condition characterized by a constant feeling of being
        rushed, anxious, and overwhelmed. People who suffer from hurry sickness tend to be in a perpetual state of hurry,
        always trying to fit more into their days than is realistically possible. This mindset can lead to increased
        stress, fatigue, and burnout. Hurry sickness can manifest in a variety of ways, including feeling restless or
        fidgety, constantly checking the time, multitasking, and feeling like there is never enough time to get
        everything done. In our fast-paced world, hurry sickness has become increasingly common, but it's essential to
        recognize its impact and take steps to slow down and prioritize rest and self-care.

        Here are a few practical ways to incorporate rest into your daily routine:
      </p>

      <ul className="">
        <li>
          Take a Sabbath day of rest each week where you unplug from work and technology and focus on rest, relaxation,
          and renewal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take breaks throughout the day to rest your mind and recharge your batteries. This could include a short walk, a
          nap, or simply taking a few deep breaths.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prioritize sleep and make sure you are getting enough quality sleep each night.
        </li>
        <li>
          Schedule regular times of reflection and solitude to gain clarity and perspective on your life and relationships.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do the things you want to do in your rest time. Prioritize your wants, there is plenty of time for the things we
          "need" to do later.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="">
        In conclusion, rest is an essential aspect of our well-being and a powerful antidote to hurry sickness. By
        embracing the wisdom of rest, we can find peace, joy, and renewal in our relationships with others and ourselves.
